# OpenHydrate
A clone of stay_hydrated_bot, after that bot stopped working. This twitch bot
will remind the streamer to drink water for each hour that they are streaming.
Currently, users can invite OpenHydrate to their own chat by entering !addbot in
OpenHydrate's chatroom. In the future I would like to implement a way for
channel moderators to invite the bot to chatrooms they moderate.
